## Motivation

The past decade has defined the era of matchmaking apps and has made meeting new people fast and convenient. But the convenience and simplicity ends once you match with someone and the question comes up, "What should I plan for the first date?". Like many others we have to look through apps such as Yelp or Eventbrite to figure out something to do within a certain area and a certain time. For working professionals this is time consuming especially after already communicating with so many matches. I built this app with the goal of making the process of finding something to do simple, but with the ultiamte goal of eliminating the thought process totally with the use of a smart algorithm. This version is the second iteration of this idea which followed a set of design principles detailed below.
